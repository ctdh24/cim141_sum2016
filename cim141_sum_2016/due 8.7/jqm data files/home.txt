    There's always something happening at Sunny Acres. With the coming of fall, we're gearing up for our big AutumnFest and Farm Show. If you haven't visited our famous be sure to do so before it gets torn down on November 5. This year's maze is bigger and better than ever.

	When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a good fright. Sunny Acres provides that too with another year of the Haunted Maze.  Please plan on joining us during weekends in October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.

	Of course, Sunny Acres is, above all, a <em>farm</em>. Our Farm Shop is always open with reasonable prices on great produce. Save even more money by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.

<p>We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.<br />
