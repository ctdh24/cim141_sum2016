    			There's always something happening at Sunny Acres. With the coming of fall, we're gearing up for our big AutumnFest and Farm Show. If you haven't visited our famous be sure to do so before it gets torn down on November 5. This year's maze is bigger and better than ever.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a good fright. Sunny Acres provides that too with another year of the Haunted Maze.  Please plan on joining us during weekends in October or on Halloween for our big Halloween Festival.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, Sunny Acres is, above all, a <em>farm</em>. Our Farm Shop is always open with reasonable prices on great produce. Save even more money by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.
			</p>
			<p>
				We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.<br />

			    Back for another year, every night the Sunny Acres Corn Maze becomes the Sunny Acres Haunted Maze. This season's maze begins with an encounter with an evil organist (played by the Council Bluffs Choir's own Glenn Frye). Explore the maze and find the zombie graveyard, the pumpkin tower, and a haunted house made of corn--not to mention the spiders, ghosts, witches, and other assorted villainy that inhabit the maze.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Haunted Maze is open the last three weekends of October with a special event on Halloween. Come early in the day to explore the larger Corn Maze,stay for a homemade meal of brats, burgers, soda, and chips, and then participate in the Halloween Festival. Special stations will be set up in the Haunted Maze for trick-or-treaters. A smaller mazeis also available that is "scare-friendly" for younger children.

				Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own right outside of Council Bluffs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope that your family gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Corn Maze as we did building it! Our family would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at this year's Corn Maze and AutumnFest.
			</p>

			<p>
			Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is filled with twists and turns that are good fun for adults and kids alike! See how adventurous you are as you wind through the maze while taking an interactive quiz. Answer the questions correctly and receive additional clues to solve the maze. For families with young children, our maze is filled with jokes, riddles, and quests. Try to be the first in your group to punch out your quest card by visiting the secret spots. This maze is the perfect size and height for little ones. Resting places and educational displays are scattered throughout.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is no water available in the maze. Make sure you bring water bottles with you! No one under the age of 12 will be allowed in the maze without an adult at any time.
